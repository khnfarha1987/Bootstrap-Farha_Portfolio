# Project Description:
This porfolio contains information provided on HTML,CSS and Bootstrap, each section shows the detail information of that specific topic.

Bootstrap is a popular front-end web development framework that is widely used to create responsive and mobile-first websites. It is a free and open-source framework that includes pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components that help developers create websites quickly and easily.

Bootstrap web templates are pre-designed website layouts that are built using the Bootstrap framework. They provide a solid foundation for developers and designers to create responsive and mobile-friendly websites without having to start from scratch. Bootstrap templates come with pre-built components such as navigation menus, buttons, forms, modals, and much more, making it easy to create a professional-looking website.

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.
